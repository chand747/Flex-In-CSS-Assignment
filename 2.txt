Explain the role of the following key properties in the Flexbox layout model.
Solution:-
1. justify-content:
- The justify-content property defines how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the main-axis of a flex container, and the inline axis of a grid container.

Some examples of justify-content are:
i) justify-content: start;
- Default value. Items are positioned at the beginning of the container.

ii) justify-content: center;
- Items are positioned in the center of the container.

iii) justify-content: space-between;
- Items will have space between them.

iv) justify-content: space-around;
- Items will have space before, between, and after them.

v) justify-content: space-evenly;
- Items will have equal space around them.


2. align-items:
- The align-items property sets the align-self value on all direct children as a group. In Flexbox, it controls the alignment of items on the Cross Axis. In Grid Layout, it controls the alignment of items on the Block Axis within their grid area.

Some examples of align-items are:
i) align-item: stretch;
- Items are stretched to fit the container.

ii) align-item: center;
- Items are positioned at the center of the container.

iii) align-item: start;
- Items are positioned at the beginning of the container.

iv) align-item: end;
- Items are positioned at the end of the container.


3. gap:
- It defines the size of the gap between the rows and between the columns in flexbox, grid or multi-column layout.
- It is also known as grid-gap.

Some examples of grid-gap are:
i) row:gap;
- Sets the size of the gap between the rows in a grid or flexbox layout.

ii) column-gap;
- Sets the size of the gap between the columns in a grid, flexbox or multi-column layout.


4. flex-direction:
- The flex-direction property sets how flex items are placed in the flex container defining the main axis and the direction (normal or reversed).

Some examples of flex-direction are:
i) flex-direction: row;
- Default value. The flexible items are displayed horizontally, as a row.

ii) flex-direction: row-reverse;
- Same as row, but in reverse order.

iii) flex-direction: column;
- The flexible items are displayed vertically, as a column.

iv) flex-direction: column-reverse;
- Same as column, but in reverse order.


5. flex-wrap:
- The flex-wrap property sets whether flex items are forced onto one line or can wrap onto multiple lines. If wrapping is allowed, it sets the direction that lines are stacked.

Some examples of flex-wrap are:
i) flex-wrap: nowrap;
- Default value. Specifies that the flexible items will not wrap.

i) flex-wrap: wrap;
- Specifies that the flexible items will wrap if necessary.

i) flex-wrap: wrap-reverse;
- Specifies that the flexible items will wrap, if necessary, in reverse order.
